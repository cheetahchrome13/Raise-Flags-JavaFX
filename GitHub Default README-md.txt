## Example Output

This image will display as your example output. Name the image README.jpg in your project folder.

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

I needed to manipulate x and y positions of an image in a incremental fashion.

### Design

I used a previous program that flashed text and substituted code to change the y position of an image

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

I tested at each step of adding code.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
